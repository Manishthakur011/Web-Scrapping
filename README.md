# Web-Scrapping
This is a part of project that I got from one of my clients who wanted to extract data from <h1> amazon best sellers from kitchen and home category</h1>.
<span> The main idea of business was to launch product that have low competition in the market. In this project we have automated the process of extracting data using selenium with python.</span>
<p> I learned a lot of things while working on this project. </p>
</p>The code for this same is provided in this repository, though i can't really provide the extracted data. </p> 
However, if this thing that can help you in some way, just drop me a mail. 
<h3>We'll get in touch!</h3>

<h2> I will soon attach the blog guide for this project for the same! Stay Tuned!</h2>
